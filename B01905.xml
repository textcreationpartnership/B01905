            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE Hackney-Coachmen.</head>
            <p>THAT by an Act made in the 13th. and 14th. Years of the Reign of the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. the Number of Hackney-Coaches was limitted to Four Hundred, and the Rent at 5 <hi>l. per Annum</hi> for every Coach, which Act expired about Fourteen Years ago, that during the time the ſaid Act was in Force, whilſt Horſemeat was cheap, the Coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſupported themſelves, and paid their Rent, but in dear Years many of them broke, and were not able to pay, whereby they loſt their Licenſes.</p>
            <p>That ſoon after the Expiration of the ſaid Act, many Inholders, Victuallers, and other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſet up Coaches, and by the greatneſs of their Number deſtroyed one another, for there have not been fewer than Fifty Perſons that have broken in every Year ſince the ſaid Act expired; and thoſe that are now in Being, have run out all they are worth, and beſides that, have contracted great Debts to Tradeſmen, in hopes of keeping up the Trade until it ſhould be regulated again in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, ſo that there is not now in being one Coachman in a Hundred that is worth One Hundred Pounds and all his Debts paid.</p>
            <p>That two Years ſince, when the Coachmen by the Poll Act, were appointed to pay Five Pounds for every Coach, divers of them not being able to pay it, were conſtrained to leave off their Calling, and by that means they and their Families are become chargeable to the Pariſhes where they live, and a many others by the dearneſs of Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat, and decay of Trade, are daily forced to leave their Trade, ſo that the Number of Hackney-Coaches kept in <hi>London,</hi> and the Places compriſed within the Weekly Bills of Mortality, in <hi>January</hi> laſt, amounted to Eight Hundred and Thirty Three, and no more, as appears by an eſtimate taken by two credible Perſons, and prov'd by their Affidavit taken before a Maſter in <hi>Chancery:</hi> And if all the Money theſe Coachmen now get were depoſited in one Perſons hands, and equally diſtributed to them all, it would not be ſufficient to buy their Horſes Meat; And if the Act ſhould paſs for ſetting a Fine of One Hundred Pounds on every Coach, and four Pounds <hi>per Annum</hi> Rent, and the Number at Eight Hundred, the ſaid Coachmen will be thereby utterly undone, and they and their Families muſt become chargeable to the Places where they live, they having not been brought up to any other Trade or Calling.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
               </label> Did not the Coachmen when Licenſed by Virtue of the ſaid Act,  ſell their Licenſes for 100 <hi>l.</hi> a Licenſe, and did not many Perſons Licenſed, that had no Coach, let their Licenſes to hire for 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Week, and why may not the ſame be done now.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
               </label> There were but very few Licenſes ſold at that Rate,  and thoſe that were ſo ſold, were bought by Perſons that knew nothing of the Trade, for it is very well known that many perſons then quitted their Licenſes, not being able to pay the Rent, which was but 5 <hi>l. per Annum;</hi> and as to the letting out their Figures at 10 <hi>s. per</hi> Week; true it is that ſome Licenſed Perſons, who had not Coaches, did in <hi>Winter</hi> time, when a Parliament was ſitting, and Horſemeat cheap, let their Licenſes ſo, but then this was but for a ſmall time, for thoſe perſons would have been glad to have let their Licenſes to any perſon by the Year, at Four Shillings a Week. And further, the Number then was but Four Hundred, and by this Act, the Number is propoſed to be doubled, ſo that there can of courſe be but half that Work to every Coach.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Objection. </seg>
               </label> That by the great increaſe of Buildings and concourſe of People,  there will be greater need of Eight Hundred Coaches, and they will have more Work than Four Hundred could have expected at the time of making the ſaid Act.</p>
            <p>
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſwer. </seg>
               </label> It is not above fourteen Years ſince the ſaid Act expired;  and the Parliament that ſate after the expiration of that Act, were of Opinion that four Hundred Coaches were ſufficient then, and had revived the ſaid Act then, but that great Application was made to them, to make the Number five Hundred, which they would not agree to; Beſides there are a great many Hundred Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Coaches and Hackney Chairs ſet up ſince the making of the ſaid Act, which very much leſſens the Hackney-Coachmens Trade, and the multitude of Buildings hath not made the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People greater, as may appear by the preſent Weekly Bills of Mortality, compared with them of the 14th Year of King <hi>Charles</hi> the II. and it hath made the Streets more commodious to walk in then they were, by which the Coachmens work is much abated.</p>
            <p>The Truth of which matters the Hackney-Coachmen can make appear to the Honourable Houſe of Commons if they may be permitted ſo to do.</p>
